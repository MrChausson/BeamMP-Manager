# BeamMP-Manager

This is a simple manager for BeamMP servers.

Feel free to use this on you own server. I will soon add a guide on how to install it

What features are available / TODO:
- [x] Start server
- [x] Stop server
- [x] Restart server
- [x] Upload resources (still needs a progress bar)
- [x] Check server status
- [ ] Update server
- [ ] Edit config
